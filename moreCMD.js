To help you understand, lets compare the "RickRoll" meme, which is globally recognized, with most Malaysian/Indonesian influencer/politician memes that are mainly known locally. The goal is to avoid cringeworthy content that lacks wider appeal. If you have an issue with our rules or administration style, the "Leave Group" button is available.\n\nIts important to recognize that every community has its own unique rules and administration style. Please refrain from comparing our community to others. We believe its unfair to compare our structured community with more "anarchy"-style communities.
